# ManyHats

![Example of swapping hats](https://github.com/nixii/ManyHats/blob/main/example0.gif)

## About
This is a simple plugin that lets you put any item on your head as a hat.
In Survival mode, you can simply click with the item on your helmet slot like you would to put on a helmet.
In any gamemode, you can run the `/hat` command to swap your current hat and held item. It's that simple!

You can't just put it on your helmet slot in creative mode due to technical limitation. But the `/hat` command will still work.

## Installation
1. Create a paper server to install the plugin on if you haven't already. I recommend the [official Paper setup 
   tutorial](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started/) found on their website.
2. Drag this plugin's JAR file (found in [Releases](#)) into your server's `plugins` directory.
3. Restart your server

## Usage
1. Type `/hat` to swap your helmet and main hand slots!
2. In Survival or Adventure mode, simply click on your head like any item!
